    btatt: fix reported dissector bug.
    
    For better or worse, currently, if you have a field that is broken into
    bitfields, the top-level field must be integral, so the entire field's
    value is shown.  A case could be made that FT_NONE should be supported,
    but that's not the case now.
    
    Fixes issue #17505.

    packet-dlm3: dissect pdus for tcp case
    
    Currently there can be multiple dlm messages in one tcp segment and in
    some cases dlm message can be overlapped between two segments. The main
    fix would be that we can now dissect multiple dlm messages if they
    appear in one tcp segment. It's still own as one message in the "packet
    flow" but in tree view it will be displayed as multiple messages which
    are not visible.
    
    For sctp the problem still exists, although there can't be overlapped messages.
