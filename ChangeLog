    frame: always add the "length < caplen" expert info.

    Add the "length < caplen" expert info regardless of whether the "frame"
    protocol is referenced by a packet-matching expression, just as we do
    with the "fractional time component of the absolute frame time is >=
    1000000000" expert info.

    Fixes #18312.

    Fix bogus tvbuffs to make sure reported length >= captured length.

    A reported length less than a captured length is bogus, as you cannot
    capture more data than there is in a packet.

    Fixes #18313.

    Linux USB: fix incorrect values for the packet length.

    When reading memory-mapped Linux capture files, fix up the "real" length
    field, in case the file was written by a program doing a capture done
    with a version of libpcap with a bug that causes it to incorrectly set
    the "real" length for isochronous transfers.

    wiretap: Do not silently limit capture length

    Libpcap assumes that packet length is greater or equal to captured data
    length. However, due to a bug in libpcap, it was possible for libpcap to
    generate isochronous URB packets (WTAP_ENCAP_USB_LINUX_MMAPPED) with
    captured data length greater than packet length. The discrepancy comes
    from slightly different semantics in Linux kernel.

    Linux kernel usbmon packet documentation mentions:
        unsigned int length;  /* 32: Length of data (submitted or actual) */
        unsigned int len_cap; /* 36: Delivered length */

    Wireshark shows usbmon packet length as URB length (usb.urb_len) and
    len_cap as Data length (usb.data_len). For usbmon isochronous IN packets
    containing data (URB complete), usbmon length is "actual". Actual length
    is the sum of payload packets length received from device. Delivered
    length refers to the amount of data associated with usbmon packet, that
    is the isochronous descriptors and actual isochronous data. There can be
    multiple isochronous descriptors in single URB and the actual payload in
    special cases can be noncontiguous (there can be gaps).

    Libpcap when reading usbmon capture calculates packet length based on
    usbmon packet structure size (64), "actual length" and number of
    isochronous descriptors. This gives expected packet length as long as
    there are no gaps between isochronous data. If there are gaps, the
    calculated packet length will be smaller than delivered length.

    Wireshark should show the frame length and captured length as provided
    by the capture engine, even if the capture length is greater than frame
    length. Silently limiting captured length essentially hides the issue
    from the user and allows misbehaving capture engine to go unnoticed.

    Passing unmodified Frame Length and Capture Length to dissectors (and
    thus complete tvb) allows USB dissector to show all ISO Data fields
    captured on Linux usbmon interface using bugged libpcap.

    Fixes #18021

    Git+CMake: Add support for CMake presets.

    CMake 3.19 added support for CMakePresets.json and
    CMakeUserPresets.json, which let you prepopulate various configure,
    build, and test options. Add CMakeUserPresets.json to .gitignore as
    recommended by the documentation and add an example to the Developer's
    Guide. CMake uses 2-space indentation; specify that for CMake*.json in
    .editorconfig.

    Make sure we don't create comment options longer than 65535 bytes.

    Check in both editcap and Wireshark to make sure that comments have
    fewer than 65536 bytes before accepting them.

    This shoudl fix #18235, although there should also be checks in
    libwiretap to catch cases where the user interface code doesn't do the
    check (it should be done in the UI so that the user gets notified
    appropriately).

    Docs: Remove the "Last updated" footer from our HTML man pages.

    The "Last updated" footer time is the last modified time of the source
    file. We could make it reproducible using something like
    git-restore-mtime, but it's easier (and IMHO less ugly) to just remove
    the footer.
