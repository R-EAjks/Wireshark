    coap: Do not handle Accept as Content-Format
    
    Only use value of Content-Format to dissect the content in the
    current packet. Accept is used to tell which format is expected
    in the reply.

    editcap doc: Fix description of split output file names
    
    The editcap documentation still refers to the pre 1.2.1 behavior
    of determining output file names when splitting based on either
    packet counts or time intervals. (See commit a8eb860103) Update
    it to reflect the current behavior.

    editcap: if -T was specified, change the linktype of all interfaces.
    
    Don't just change the linktype of the file (if it has one) and the
    linktypes of all the packets, change the linktype of all interfaces as
    well.
    
    Fixes #17520.

    validate-clang-check: fix some issues.
    
    Not all shells support [[ ]] compound commands; it's not in the most
    recent Single UNIX Specification I could see, and the
    ubuntu-clang-other-tests job is reporting
    
        tools/validate-clang-check.sh: 18: [[: not found
    
    Don't use [[ ]].
    
    In addition, if you change extcap/etl.c, it tries to run clang-check on
    it, but that file builds, and is only built, on Windows, so clang-check
    fails dismally on UN*Xes.  Omit it for now.

    btatt: fix reported dissector bug.
    
    For better or worse, currently, if you have a field that is broken into
    bitfields, the top-level field must be integral, so the entire field's
    value is shown.  A case could be made that FT_NONE should be supported,
    but that's not the case now.
    
    Fixes issue #17505.

    packet-dlm3: dissect pdus for tcp case
    
    Currently there can be multiple dlm messages in one tcp segment and in
    some cases dlm message can be overlapped between two segments. The main
    fix would be that we can now dissect multiple dlm messages if they
    appear in one tcp segment. It's still own as one message in the "packet
    flow" but in tree view it will be displayed as multiple messages which
    are not visible.
    
    For sctp the problem still exists, although there can't be overlapped messages.
