    ZigBee ZCL: fix the zero-length item check.

    The fix for #17926 got the check backwards, so non-empty arrays, sets,
    and bags couldn't be dissected, as they'd always report a "zero-length
    item" error.  Both versions of the check dissect zero-length items, as
    they test for equality, but the old version thought that a
    non-zero-length item was also bad, as the offset was greater after
    dissecting the item than before dissecting the item.

    CMS: get rid of globals

    Get rid of the global content_tvb and object_identifier_id in
    the CMS dissector, and put them in a packet scoped proto data
    struct, so that when there's a non fatal exception retrieving
    the OID we don't use the global value from a previous packet
    (or worse, file), since what the content_tvb and object_identifier_id
    pointed to were both packet scoped that could lead to memory
    access violations.

    Clear the values of the OID and the content_tvb each time before
    they are retrieved, so that values from a previous PDU of CMS
    in the same packet aren't used either. This was not quite as bad
    as using a value already freed, but still bad.

    Fix #17800, #17809, #17835, #17935

    PROFINET: Fix incorrect API call, assertion

    Fix two calls of proto_tree_add_item() when proto_tree_add_uint()
    was meant. Passing the actual value of a field instead of an encoding
    into proto_tree_add_item() has unexpected results. Fix #17909.

    (The whole area of this dissector would probably be cleaner with
    more calls to add_item(), but this is a smaller change consistent
    with the rest.)

    Kafka: Be more strict when dissecting varints.

    The Kafka dissector uses the return value of tvb_get_varint to advance
    the packet offset in many places. If tvb_get_varint fails it returns 0,
    which means our offset isn't guaranteed to advance. Stop dissection
    whenever that happens. Fixes #17811.

    maxes out at 2^22, so use that.

    Kafka: Fixup returned offsets and initialize variables.

    Many of the Kafka dissector's type dissection routines either returned
    an offset or -1 in the event of an error. We don't appear to check for
    errors anywhere, so ensure that those routines always return a valid
    offset.

    Make those routines always initialize their type offset and length
    variables. Fixes #16985.
