    epan: don't print nanoseconds if seconds isn't representable.
    
    Fix for previous fixes to #17179.

commit 565de9c3c3
Author: Guy Harris <gharris@sonic.net>
Date:   Thu Jan 28 06:15:31 2021 +0000

    epan: don't use gmtime_s().
    
    It has the "feature" that, if handed a negative value, it might just
    exit.  gmtime() doesn't have that "feature", and is sufficiently
    thread-safe for our purposes; use it instead, and check to make sure it
    doesn't return a null pointer.
    
    The previous fix for #17179 still used gmtime_s(); this doesn't, so it's
    a better fix for #17179.

commit 2ac6196dde
Author: Guy Harris <gharris@sonic.net>
Date:   Thu Jan 28 05:46:11 2021 +0000

    epan: don't assume gmtime_s() or gmtime_r() succeed.
    
    At least on Windows, gmtime_s() will *not* succeed if passed a negative
    value.
    
    Fixes #17179.

    Qt+tools: Fix most of our lupdate warnings.
    
    Fix various warnings with the following changes:
    
    Pass a list of include directories to lupdate. Fixes:
    
        ui/qt/proto_tree.cpp:57: Qualifying with unknown namespace/class ::ProtoTree
    
    and similar warnings.
    
    Use QT_TRANSLATE_NOOP instead of QT_TR_NOOP. Fixes:
    
        ui/qt/lte_rlc_statistics_dialog.cpp:993: tr() cannot be called without context
        ui/qt/lte_mac_statistics_dialog.cpp:911: tr() cannot be called without context
        ui/qt/font_color_preferences_frame.cpp:28: tr() cannot be called without context
        ui/qt/font_color_preferences_frame.cpp:29: tr() cannot be called without context
        ui/qt/font_color_preferences_frame.cpp:30: Discarding unconsumed meta data
    
    Add Q_OBJECT to the class definition. Fixes:
    
        ui/qt/models/filter_list_model.cpp:120: Class 'FilterListModel' lacks Q_OBJECT macro
    
    The following warnings were not fixed. This might require moving IOGraph
    to its own file:
    
        ui/qt/io_graph_dialog.cpp:320: Qualifying with unknown namespace/class ::IOGraphDialog
        ui/qt/io_graph_dialog.cpp:555: Qualifying with unknown namespace/class ::IOGraphDialog

    dumpcap: Improve the secondary error for promiscuous mode failure.
    
    On Windows, some devices don't let promiscuous mode be enabled, and
    return an error rather than silently ignoring the request to use
    promiscuous mode (as UN*X devices tend to do).  Check for the error
    message from that error, and suggest that the user turn off promiscuous
    mode on that device.

    macos-setup: clean up uninstallation of snappy.
    
    For a CMake build done in a subdirectory of the source directory, the
    equivalent of "make distclean" is "rm -rf {that subdirectory}".  Make it
    so.
    
    When uninstalling the stuff snappy installs with "rm -rf", use $DO_RM,
    so it's done with sudo iff /usr/local isn't writable by us, just as
    "make uninstall" is done with $DO_MAKE_UNINSTALL so it's done with sudo
    iff /usr/local isn't writable by us.
    
    Fix up the list of what to remove, now that we're building snappy as a
    shared library, so that it removes shared libraries rather than the
    non-existent static library.
    
    Update a comment while we're at it, as Lua isn't the only dependency
    that doesn't support "make uninstall".

    macos-setup: build snappy as a shared library.
    
    The older versions of snappy apparently used autotools and build a
    shared library by default; for example, Wireshark 3.2.6 for macOS is
    built with snappy, and includes a snappy dynamic library in the app
    bundle.
    
    The current version uses CMake and does *not* build a shared library by
    default.  Instead, it builds a static library, which, when you try to
    link it to a C-only shared library...
    
    ...does not work.
    
    The linker sees that you're statically linking in a bunch of C++ .o
    files and gets upset because it can't find C++ standard library routines
    used by that code.
    
    If it's a dynamic library, the library was itself already linked with
    the C++ standard library, so the external references to that library
    from the snappy library are already marked as having been resolved to
    the extent that they're expected to be in the C++ standard library at
    run time - and, when the dynamic snappy library is built, it's marked as
    depending on the C++ standard library, so the run time linker will, when
    it loads the snappy dynamic library, see that the C++ standard library
    is required and will load it if it hasn't already been loaded.

    Snappy uses CMake, and they didn't bother to provide an unintall target.
    
    Or a distclean target, for that matter.
    
    Do the best we can.
    
    (libpcap and tcpdump support both autotools and CMake, and Wireshark
    uses only CMake; all of them support an uninstall target in CMake.  Go
    forth, read what they did, and sin no more.)

    Work around more NeXTStEP-induced pain.
    
    GNU libtool has a libtool program and a libtoolize program.
    
    The development tools for NeXTStEP, apparently, had a libtool program as
    well, and the current version of the development tools for the current
    version of NeXTStEP, generally known as "Xcode for macOS", still have
    that program.
    
    This means that we do some renaming after installing GNU libtool, so
    that its "libtool" becomes "glibtool" and its "libtoolize" becomes
    "glibtoolize".
    
    That meant we had to compensate for that when running autoreconf when
    building and installing minizip.
    
    It turns out we have to do that when running autogen.sh when building
    and installing GLib as well.

    macOS: Enable PKCS #11 support when building with macos-setup.sh
    
    Enable PKCS #11 support in macOS builds with macos-setup.sh (already
    supported on macOS via Homebrew and on all other OSes with GnuTLS 3.4
    or greater) by installing p11-kit (and its dependency libtasn1) and
    building nettle and GnuTLS against it.

    macos-setup.sh: Update various software versions
    
    Update versions of xz, lzip, gettext, libgpg, libgpg-error, libgcrypt, gnutls and gmp
    to newest releases.
    
    Also update glib but only to last version with autotools support - meson build is left
    for another time.
    
    Current versions of glib require a libpcre with unicode enabled which the Catalina system
    version does not provide, so install the current version of libpcre as well.
    
    Update some additional tools to commit 3a42bf0de2b9e35efcc3cea38153ab95cb71b352:
    brotli, libmaxminddb, lz4, and snappy

    These are the versions being used to build 3.2, so we're updating this
    so that the 3.2 source tree's macos-setup.sh can be used to set up the
    build environment for 3.2, except for some support libraries used by 3.4
    and later, but not by 3.2.
