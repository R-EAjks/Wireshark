    ENC_TIME_MIP6 and ENC_TIME_CLASSIC_MAC_OS_SECS were added recently by
    factoring them out of specific dissectors, but they weren't documented.
    I added documentation, based on comments in the dissector code they came
    from.

    Tools: Make the Debian and RPM setup scripts more strict.

    We use debian-setup.sh and rpm-setup.sh to build the containers in
    https://gitlab.com/wireshark/wireshark-containers/. Make sure they fail
    with a nonzero exit status, otherwise we might end up with an invalid
    container image.

    Make sure OPTIONS is defined in all of the setup scripts that use it.

    icmpv6: Fix dissection of PREF64 option for shorter prefixes

    RFC 8781 shows in section 4 that the prefix field of the PREF64 option
    header is always 96 bits (or 12 bytes), regardless of the prefix length
    code that only specifies which parts of the prefix are significant. The
    option itself thus always has a fixed length. Even if they are not used
    in the significant part of the prefix itself, the unused bits are still
    part of the prefix field of the PREF64 option and the offset must be
    adapted accordingly.

    The previous implementation would fail to correctly parse any PREF64
    option with a PLC other than 0 (i.e. the full 96 bits) due to the unused
    remaining bits in the option not being consumed.

    Closes #18033.

    rdp: Register RDP as a TLS subdissector for port 3389 directly

    ssl_dissector_add registers TLS as the dissector for TCP for the given
    port. We can't use it, since on port 3389 TPKT (for RDP) can be over TLS
    or directly over TCP, depending on the RDP security settings.
    Fix #17952.
