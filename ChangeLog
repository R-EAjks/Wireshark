    NSIS: Use the correct Visual C++ Redistributable file name.

    Make sure the file we attempt to execute is the one we include with
    our installer. Fixes #17893.

    NSIS: Remove some confusing error message text.

    If the Visual C++ Redistributable installation fails, don't point users
    to KB2999226. It applied to Windows 8.1 and earlier, and is more likely
    to cause confusion than help fix the problem. Ping #17748.
