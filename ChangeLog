    to be the PROFIsafe element, otherwise the description
    is not parsed.

    DNP: use the proper free function
    
    g618661b22e introduced a free for a so called memory leak (which wasn't
    a real leak due to the pinfo->pool garbage collector) but used the wrong
    free function. Let's keep the explicit free but use the right function.
    
    Closes #17462

    wireless_timeline: make sure the hash table is always allocated.
    
    At least on my Mac, if I start up Wireshark, start a capture
    (non-monitor-mode) on the Wi-Fi adapter, add a comment to the SHB and
    the first packet while it's capturing, stop the capture, and try to save
    it, it warns that the wireless timeline hash table pointer is null.
    
    Allocate it in the constructor.

    Explain, in detail, exactly what it's trying to do and, for each of the
    three commands in the example, what each step does, as well as
    explaining what the calculation using the end time of one capture and
    start time of another capture is doing.
    
    (Where did this example come from?  What is the real-world goal of this
    exercise?  And why is it an example in which all the fancy stuff is done
    in commands *other* than mergecap?)

    pcap-common: set the time stamp precision correctly for LINKTYPE_ERF.
    
    LINKTYPE_ERF pcap files are really ERF files inside a thin pcap wrapper
    (don't even ask what a pcapng file with some or all interfaces being
    LINKTYPE_ERF is...), so the time stamp comes from the ERF record, not
    from the pcap packet header or pcapng block header.
    
    The time stamp reslution for the record should reflect that, so set it
    to WTAP_TSPREC_NSEC (ERF time stamps are fractional-power-of-2, not
    fractional-power-of-10, so that's the best we can do).

    erf: set the tsprecision value of a newly-created IDB.
    
    Don't assume the default is correct, because there's no guarantee of
    that - in fact, there's currently a guarantee that it's not, as it's
    initialized to 0, which is WTAP_TSPREC_SECS.

    wslua_tvb: fix documentation for reported_length_remaining().
    
    In the past, tvb_reported_length_remaining(), and thus
    Tvb:reported_length_remaining(), may have returned -1 if the offset was
    invalid.  That's no longer the case; the former returns 0, and, as the
    latter just returns the former's return value, that's true of the latter
    as well.

    wslua: a tvbuff doesn't have an "actual length".
    
    It has a "reported length", which is the closes thing to an "actual
    length", as it represents the length the packet, or subset thereof, had
    on the network, and a "captured length", which is the amount of the
    packet that the capture process saved.
    
    In 99.999999999999999999999999999999% of all cases, a dissector should
    look at the "reported length", not at the "captured length".
    
    Rename the "len" method to "captured_len", leaving "len" around for
    backwards compatibility.
    
    Fix the documentation to reflect reality, to avoid issues such as #15655.

    For 802.11n if the bitrate is not supplied then the calculated bitrate is used. This change does the same for 11ac.
    
    Sniffer traces taken on recent versions of Macos no longer supply the bitrate for 11ac frames in the RADIOTAP header, this change allows the wireless timeline to work with these traces.
    
    Fixes #17419.
