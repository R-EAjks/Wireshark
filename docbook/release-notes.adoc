=== New and Updated Features

* The 'console.log.level' preference was removed in Wireshark 3.6.0.
This release adds an '-o console.log.level:' backward-compatibilty option on the CLI that maps to the new logging sub-system.
Note that this does not have bitmask semantics and does not correspond to any actual preference.
It is just a transition mechanism for users that were relying on this CLI option and will be removed in the future.
To see the new diagnostic output options consult the manpages or the output of '--help'.
