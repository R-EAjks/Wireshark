[[ChTelephony]]

== Telephony

[[ChTelIntroduction]]

=== Introduction

Wireshark provides a wide range of telephony related network statistics which
can be accessed via the menu:Telephony[] menu.

These statistics range from specific signaling protocols, to analysis of
signaling and media flows. If encoded in a compatible encoding the media flow
can even be played.

The protocol specific statistics windows display detailed information of
specific protocols and might be described in a later version of this document.

Some of these statistics are described at the
{wireshark-wiki-url}Statistics pages.

[[ChTelVoipCalls]]

=== VoIP Calls

The VoIP Calls window shows a list of all detected VoIP calls in the captured
traffic. It finds calls by their signaling.

More details can be found on the {wireshark-wiki-url}VoIP_calls page.


[[ChTelANSI]]

=== ANSI

This menu shows groups of statistic data for mobile communication protocols according to ETSI GSM standards.

==== A-I/F BSMAP Statistics

The A-Interface Base Station Management Application Part (BSMAP) Statistics window shows the messages list and the number of the captured messages. There is a possibility to filter the messages, copy or save the date into a file.

==== A-I/F DTAP Statistics

The A-Interface Direct Transfer Application Part (DTAP) Statistics widow shows the messages list and the number of the captured messages. There is a possibility to filter the messages, copy or save the date into a file. 

[[ChTelGSM]]

=== GSM

The Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM) is a standard for mobile networks. This menu shows a group of statistic data for mobile communication protocols according to ETSI GSM standard.

[[ChTelIAX2Analysis]]

=== IAX2 Stream Analysis

The “IAX2 Stream Analysis” dialog shows statistics for the forward and reverse
streams of a selected IAX2 call along with a graph.

[[ChTelISUPMessages]]

=== ISUP Messages

Integrated Service User Part (ISUP) protocol provides voice and non-voice signalling for telephone communications. ISUP Messages menu opens the window which shows the related statistics. The user can filter, copy or save the data into a file.

[[ChTelLTE]]

=== LTE

[[ChTelLTEMACTraffic]]

==== LTE MAC Traffic Statistics

Statistics of the captured LTE MAC traffic. This window will summarize the LTE
MAC traffic found in the capture.

The top pane shows statistics for common channels. Each row in the middle pane
shows statistical highlights for exactly one UE/C-RNTI. In the lower pane, you
can see the for the currently selected UE/C-RNTI the traffic broken down by
individual channel.

[[ChTelLTERLCGraph]]

==== LTE RLC Graph

The LTE RLC Graph menu launches a graph which shows LTE Radio Link Control protocol sequence numbers changing over time along with acknowledgements which are received in the opposite direction.

NOTE: That graph shows data of a single bearer and direction. The user can also launch it from the `RLC Statistics` window.

[[ChTelLTERLCTraffic]]

==== LTE RLC Traffic Statistics

Statistics of the captured LTE RLC traffic. This window will summarize the LTE
RLC traffic found in the capture.

At the top, the check-box allows this window to include RLC PDUs found within
MAC PDUs or not. This will affect both the PDUs counted as well as the display
filters generated (see below).

The upper list shows summaries of each active UE. Each row in the lower list
shows statistical highlights for individual channels within the selected UE.

The lower part of the windows allows display filters to be generated and set for
the selected channel. Note that in the case of Acknowledged Mode channels, if a
single direction is chosen, the generated filter will show data in that
direction and control PDUs in the opposite direction.

[[ChTelMTP3]]

=== MTP3

The Message Transfer Part level 3 (MTP3) protocol is a part of the Signaling System 7 (SS7). The Public Switched Telephone Networks use it for reliable, unduplicated and in-sequence transport of SS7 messaging between communication partners.

This menu shows MTP3 Statistics and MTP3 Summary windows.

[[ChTelOsmux]]

=== Osmux

OSmux is a multiplex protocol which benefits satellite based GSM back-haul systems by reducing the bandwidth consumption of the voice proxying (RTP-AMR) and signalling traffic. The OSmux menu opens the packet counter window with the related statistic data. The user can filter, copy or save the data into a file.

[[ChTelRTPAnalysis]]

=== RTP Analysis

The RTP analysis function takes the selected RTP stream (and the reverse stream,
if possible) and generates a list of statistics on it.

.The “RTP Stream Analysis” window
image::wsug_graphics/ws-tel-rtpstream-analysis.png[{screenshot-attrs}]

Starting with basic data as packet number and sequence number, further
statistics are created based on arrival time, delay, jitter, packet size, etc.

Besides the per packet statistics, the lower pane shows the overall statistics,
with minimums and maximums for delta, jitter and clock skew. Also an indication
of lost packets is included.

The RTP Stream Analysis window further provides the option to save the RTP
payload (as raw data or, if in a PCM encoding, in an Audio file). Other options
a to export and plot various statistics on the RTP streams.

[[ChTelRtpPlayer]]

The RTP Player window lets you play back RTP audio data. In order to use
this feature your version of Wireshark must support audio and the codecs
used by each RTP stream.

More details can be found on the
{wireshark-wiki-url}VoIP_calls page.

[[ChTelRTSP]]

=== RTSP

In the Real Time Streaming Protocol (RTSP) menu the user can check the Packet Counter window. It shows Total RTCP Packets and divided into RTSP Response Packets, RTSP Request Packets and Other RTSP packets. The user can filter, copy or save the data into a file.

[[ChTelSCTP]]

=== SCTP

{missing}

[[ChTelSMPPOperations]]

=== SMPP Operations

{missing}

[[ChTelUCPMessages]]

=== UCP Messages

The Universal Computer Protocol (UCP) plays role in transferring Short Messages between a Short Message Service Centre (SMSC) and an application, which is using transport protocol, such as TCP or X.25. The UCP Messages window displays the related statistical data. The user can filter, copy or save the data into a file.

[[ChTelH225]]

=== H.225

H.225 telecommunication protocol which is responsible for messages in call signalling and media stream packetization for packet-based multimedia communication systems. The H.225 window shows the counted messages by types and reasons. The user can filter, copy or save the data into a file.

[[ChTelSIPFlows]]

=== SIP Flows

Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Flows window shows the list of all captured SIP transactions, such as client registrations, messages, calls and so on. 

NOTE: This window will list both complete and in-progress SIP transactions.

User's operations in the window:

* Filtering the captured data. To do so, click the btn:[Prepare Filter] button.
* Checking the sequence diagram. To do so, click the btn:[Flow Sequence] button.
* Listen to the captured RTP stream if a decoder for the payload exists. To do so, click the btn:[Play Streams] button.
* Copy the data in the `SCV` or `YAML` format.

[[ChTelSIPStatistics]]

=== SIP Statistics

SIP Statistics window shows captured SIP transactions. It is divided into SIP Responses and SIP Requests. In this window the user can filter, copy or save the statistics into a file.  

[[ChTelWAPWSPPacketCounter]]

=== WAP-WSP Packet Counter

The WAP-WSP Packet Counter menu displays the number of packets for each Status Code and PDU Type in Wireless Session Protocol traffic. The user can filter, copy or save the data into a file.
